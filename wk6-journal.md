"Contrary to other disciplines like sociology, in which ideas from graph theory were
rapidly adopted and where social network analysis has developed into a major paradigm
(Freeman 2004; Wasserman and Faust 1994), network analysis has only recently become popular
as a method for archaeological research" Brughmans, Tom. 2010. “Connecting the dots: Towards archaeological network analysis” Oxford Journal of Archaeology, 29:3, 277.

I remember reading a paper a while back by Guy Sanders titled "Central Places and Major roads in the Peloponnese", https://www.academia.edu/373200/Central_Places_and_Major_roads_in_the_Peloponnese, where he uses graph theory and vectors I cannot understand to perform a network analysis of roads in the Peloponnese. This was published in 1990 which according to the article by Brughmans, is an early date for such analysis to have taken place. Guy Sanders' paper was very interesting to read and tangible in my head since many of the roads which he performed network analysis on, which were used in antiquity through to the modern world, have been replaced by highways, almost all of which I have actually driven on.

"In his work on Roman networks, Graham (2006a; 2006b; 2009) purposefully adopts
a social network analysis method. He states that ‘Individuals must make something of these
interconnections, for the networks to work’ (Graham 2009, 675; see also Graham 2006b, 49)." Brughmans, Tom. 2010. “Connecting the dots: Towards archaeological network analysis” Oxford Journal of Archaeology, 29:3, 282.

This reminds me of the work I did digitizing all the paths in a particular area in southern Mani on ArcGIS. I was looking at old georeferenced aerial photos and modern sattelite imagery to accomplish this. What became obvious is that Mani of the 50's, 60's, 70's... up until the turn of the century was still a very rural and agriculturally productive area. Paths lead to settlements and terraced farms. As people began to leave Mani, many villages became abandoned, so their paths became abandoned "Individuals must make something of these interconnections, for the networks to work" and since people left, their farms were also abandoned, with the paths becoming overgrown. In very few places in this part of Mani there is a paved road, basically only one, which simply serves to connect tourist destinations to the rest of Greece. This reflects the change in industry in modern Greece; tourism accounts for an entire third of the GDP of all of Greece. So people are using and leaving behind networks that appeal to their needs at a certain point in time.

"Although there is a clear potential for network analysis as a method for archaeology,
thus far it has been insufficiently explored and dominated by perspectives adopted from other
disciplines. The need exists to work towards a specifically archaeological network analysis,
drawing on the relational thinking of network theory and incorporating archaeological data
critique and reasoning." Brughmans, Tom. 2010. “Connecting the dots: Towards archaeological network analysis” Oxford Journal of Archaeology, 29:3, 299.

I feel that this is true of most new scientific applications in archaeology. They begin as strictly scientific, but quickly develop to be a genuine archaeological method, such as carbon-14 dating.

I checked out the ORBIS website of the Roman road networks, which was interesting to see. Is this project complete yet? There is not a single road in the entire Peloponnese, or does it just diplay major roads? There are many more roads in the modern UK which makes me think its not done yet.
